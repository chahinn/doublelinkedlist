# doublelinkedlist
Implementation of a doubly linked list and a Most Recently used List that speeds the process of word searches.


The files contain a doubly linked list class, and a MRUList<> class created with doubly linked list class. After that the files are tested and the 
MRUList searches for words faster, as it moves to the recent search to the front of the list. The program was tested and the MRUList delivered faster search results than the normal lsit.
